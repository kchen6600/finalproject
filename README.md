# finalproject

This project is a glorified post-it note program that acts as a combination of the stickies program on macOS and a text editor. The program includes a sidebar that allows the user to create and delete notes as well as see a list of saved notes and open various ones. Notes can be opened, edited, and saved, including font styling, uploading images, and notes can be read aloud.

List of Working features / Things I should test:
- opening, editing, and saving a file
- selecting font size and font family of the notes and saving font styling changes
- only lets you save a file if changes have been made
- uploading images
- text to speech option

List of unresolved bugs:
- the automated bullet points feature is glitchy
- remembers position of pane when last saved, but doesn't allow you to make the edit of moving the pane and saving just that change (componentlistener was not working)

Directions on how to compile and run your code:
- compile and run Sidebar.java with .:jar/*

Directions on how to use your program:
- Running Sidebar opens a sidebar that lets you create a note or open a saved note.
- Open a note by clicking the "Create Note" button and open a saved note by clicking the button with the title of the note you would like to open.
- Click save to save changes.
