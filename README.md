# finalproject

This project is a glorified post-it note program that acts as a combination of the stickies program on macOS and a text editor. The program includes a sidebar that allows the user to create and delete notes as well as see a list of saved notes and open various ones. Notes can be opened, edited, and saved, including font styling, uploading images, and notes can be read aloud.

List of Working features / Things I should test:
- opening, editing, and saving a file
- only lets you save a file if changes have been made
- uploading images

List of unresolved bugs:
- the automated bullet points feature is glitchy

Directions on how to compile and run your code:
- compile and run Sidebar.java with .:jar/*

Directions on how to use your program:
- Running Sidebar opens a sidebar that lets you create a note or open a saved note.
- Open a note by clicking the "Create Note" button and open a saved note by clicking the button with the title of the note you would like to open.
- Click save to save changes.
